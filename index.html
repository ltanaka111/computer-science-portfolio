    <h2>Little About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Leon Tanaka and I am from Honolulu, Hawaii. I moved to Japan when I was little until Kingdergarden then moved back here, and I also speak Japanese aswell. Some of my favorite hobbies are playing story games espcially rpg games and one of the current game I've played is Hello Charlotte, which has a very good story and overall just a good game and it is my current top one game as for now. I also like to edit on this software called After Effects in my freetime and post it online. </p>
